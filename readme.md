# Tailstrap

Pre-built Bootstrap-style components for Tailwind

Tailstrap is a beautifuly handcrafted library that allows you to keep you beloved bootstrap components all the while moving to the flexibility of tailwindcss.

Naturally it wasn't built to be a components library but if you want you can sift through the code for the example. Most of the docs were written for JSX and especially React/Next.js. The code is already provided but there is a lot of fundamental design priniciples inside of the code. One example is that, we migrated Next to 13 and there is still some left over code remains.
